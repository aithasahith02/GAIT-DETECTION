# GAIT-DETECTION
The detection of bend pose can be calculated by the distance calculation between the joints of neck and nose. Here the minimum distance will be given and that minimum value can be observed by giving many images and many videos as inputs. Thus, they will be detected as inactive persons since they are walking with bend position and this can be done by OpenCV, Deep Learning.
